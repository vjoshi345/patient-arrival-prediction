Statistical and machine learning models to predict patient arrival to the ED. Patient arrival is predicted for different ESI's (ESI1-ESI5) and the Total volume. We do short-term forecasts (hourly prediction for the next day), medium-term forecasts (daily prediction for the next week), and long-term forecasts (daily prediction for 90 days).
